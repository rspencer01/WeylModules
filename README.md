# The Weyl modules package

This is the README file for the GAP package "WeylModules". You must
have a working copy of GAP installed in order to use this package.

The package provides functions for doing computations with Weyl modules
in positive characteristic for a semisimple simply-connected algebraic
group. 

The package is not yet submitted to GAP.  For updates between releases
of GAP itself check the package Web page, at
http://doty.math.luc.edu/weylmodules.
  
After downloading the package, start GAP from the download directory,
and type
```
  LoadPackage("WeylModules");
```
or if starting GAP from a different directory, then run `SetPackagePath`
or `ExtendRootDirectories` to tell GAP where to find the package. (See
Chapter 76 of the
[GAP Manual](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap76.html).)

For details on  how  to  use  the  WeylModules  package  see  the  package
documentation in the `doc' subdirectory (view either `manual.dvi'  via
`xdvi' or or `manual.pdf' via a PDF viewer).
