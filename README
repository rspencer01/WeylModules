                             The Weyl modules package

This is the README file for the GAP package "Weyl Modules".

This package provides functions for doing computations with Weyl modules
in positive characteristic for a semisimple simply-connected algebraic
group. 

The  package is not yet submitted to GAP.  For updates
between releases of GAP itself check the package Web page
     http://doty.math.luc.edu/WeylModules
  

The Example package uses an external binary and therefore  a  complete
installation only works on UNIX systems  or  systems  that  support  a
UNIX-like environment, e.g. Macintosh OSX,  or  Windows  with  Cygwin.
However,  a  partial  installation  without  the  external  binary  is
possible on any system.

     Installing  a complete Example package (with external binary)

To  complete the  installation of  the ``Example''  package go  to the
directory `example'  created (the  directory contains  a copy  of this
README file) and call

  /bin/sh ./configure <path>

where <path> is a path to the main GAP root directory; so normally you
would call

  /bin/sh ./configure ../..

(the ../.. is the default and so may be omitted) and then call

  make 
  
to compile the binary.

If you installed GAP on several architectures, you  must  execute  the
configure/make steps for  the  ``Example''  package  on  each  of  the
architectures  immediately  after  configuring  GAP  itself  on   this
architecture.

That's it. Now start GAP and type

  LoadPackage("example");

The ``Example" package banner should appear on the screen. If you have
not compiled the external binary, you  should  receive  a  warning  of
this.

For details on  how  to  use  the  Example  package  see  the  package
documentation in the `doc' subdirectory (view either `manual.dvi'  via
`xdvi' or or `manual.pdf' via a PDF viewer). You will find  additional
information on how to create a GAP package  in  the  Appendix  of  the
manual.
