\Chapter{Acknowledgement}

The development of this software was initiated in June 2003 while the
author was visiting the Department of Pure Mathematics and
Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS) at the University of Cambridge, and
continued during subsequent visits to DPMMS in June 2004 and in May
through July of 2007.  The author was supported by a Yip Fellowship at
Magdalene College, Cambridge in 2007.

The final stages of development took place in Chicago and in January
2009 at Universit\accent127at Bielefeld, where the author was
supported by a Mercator grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
(DFG).

\bigskip

The existence of this software owes much to the gentle prodding of
Stuart Martin. Thanks are also due to Yutaka Yoshii for testing an
earlier version of the software, and Matt Fayers for supplying his
\GAP\ code for computing the Mullineux map.
